<p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/">CWI</a>, located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>

<p>My research interests include programming languages in general and 
parsing techniques in particular. With <a href="http://anastassija.github.io">Anastasia Izmaylova</a>, 
we developed a faster GLL parser, a data-dependent parsing framework called Iguana, and 
general parser combinators.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I obtained my Master's degree with distinction (cum laude)
from Eindhoven University of Technology in 2012. Before that I was involved in 
enterprise Java development.</p>

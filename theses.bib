abstract = {One of the main difficulties in developing domain-specific languages is the use of deterministic parsing technologies in language workbenches. These deterministic parsers do not naturally support modularity, and impose restrictions on defining the grammar of a language. For example, LL(k) parsers cannot deal with left recursion or ambiguities, which have to be removed by rewriting the grammar. These modifications usually lead to a grammar definition which is not readable and may cause maintenance problems. More importantly, the parse trees from a modified grammar may be significantly different from the ones of the original, ambiguous grammar. This may cause problems in processing parse trees, for example, for mapping to EMF models.
In this thesis, we present a new language workbench based on the GLL parsing algorithm. GLL is able to parse the full class of context-free grammars without any limitation and thus inherently supports modularity. Being a generalized parser, GLL produces a parse forest containing all the ambiguities. Our disambiguation method is based on pattern matching and rewriting within the resulting parse forest. One of the motivations for our disambiguation mechanism is solving hard parsing problems such as language embeddings and extensions. In addition, we present an error reporting mechanism for GLL-based parsers, an Eclipse plugin for developing new languages, and facilities for the mapping of ambiguous, complex concrete syntax to EMF models.},
